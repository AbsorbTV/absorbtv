# AbsorbTV

Mono repo for everything involving the AbsorbTV site.

## What?

AbsorbTV is at some point in time (who knows when) going to be a TV-series tracker. Born out of frustration with every other site either missing features I personally wanted, or having too much fluff. It aims to be a really minimalistic and straightforward site/app that makes it easy to keep track of what TV-series episodes you've watched, and to see which ones are left to watch. It's currently very much a side project that I barely work on in my spare time, and am using as a learning project.

## Technology

- Deployment is handled by Pulumi
- Backend uses Google Cloud Platform
- Frontend made with React and TypeScript
- Database update tool made in Node.js
- Using TVmaze API to get series information
